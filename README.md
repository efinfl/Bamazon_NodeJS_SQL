# Bamazon NodeJS SQL
This is a command line node JS and SQL app in which a user can "buy" items from a hypothetical store, "Bamazon".

## How it works

### Product Listing 
A table of available items is displayed. Each item displays it's item id, product name, department, price, and stock quantity.

### Product Id Prompt
The user is asked to input the id number of the product desired. If the user's input is invalid (such as a letter), they are asked to resubmit.

### Quantity Prompt
Once a valid item id is input, the user is asked for the quantity desired. If the quantity exceeds the stock quantity, they are asked to submit a lower number.

### Final "Purchase" and Stock Quantity Update
Once a valid quantity has been input, the user is notified that the order has been submitted. The quantity is updated, and new table is displayed.
